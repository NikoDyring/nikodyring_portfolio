          text_html: "I'm a pragmatic full-stack developer with a strong focus on Ruby on Rails and building products that actually solve problems. I thrive in fast-moving, structured startup environments where autonomy, clear communication, and shipping real features matter. I've worked across legacy codebases, greenfield MVPs, and cross-functional teams, always with an eye for clarity, maintainability, and impact. I care about building scalable architecture, reducing complexity, and improving the developer experience for everyone involved."
